## Causes of worldwide land degradation

The pie chart illustrates the four important reasons why agricultural land becomes less productive. The table compares the proportions of these causes affected the regions (North American, Europe and Oceania) during the 1990s.

Overall, the majority of the causes of worldwide land degradation was over-grazing, which accounted for 35% among the five reasons. The most percentage of the land degradation in these regions was Europe, at 23% totally.

From the pie chart, it is evident that deforestation was the second reason of the land degradation that followed by the over-grazing, at 30%. And next was the over-cultivation, accounting for 30%. The less one was other reason, at 7%.

As we can seen from the table, Europe had total 23% land degraded which ranked first, deforestation, over-cultivation and over-grazing, accounting for 9.8%, 7.7% and 5.5%, respectively. The next region was Oceania which had 13% land degraded effected by previous three reasons at 1.7%, 0 and 11.3 separately. The least one was North America which only had 5% land degraded effected.
