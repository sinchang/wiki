The chart illustrates the amount of money spent on five consume goods (cars, computers, books, perfume and cameras) in France and the UK in 2010. Units are measured in pounds sterling.

Overall, the UK spent more money on consumer goods than France in the period given. Both the British and French spent most of their money on cars whereas the least amount of money was spent on perfume in the UK compared to cameras in France. Furthermore, the most significant difference in expenditure between the two countries wa on camera.

In terms of cars, people in the UK spent about $450,000 on this as opposed to the French at $400,000. Similarly, the British expenditure was higher on books than the French (around $400,000 and $300,000 respectively). In the UK, expenditure on cameras (just over $350,000) was over double that of France, which was only $150,000.

On the other hand, the amount of money paid out on the remaining goods was higher in Franc. Above $350,000 was spent by the French on computers which was sightly more than the British who spent exactly $350,000. Neither of the countries spent much on perfume which accounted for $200,000 of expenditure in France but under $150,000 in the UK.

The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.

It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount.

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.
