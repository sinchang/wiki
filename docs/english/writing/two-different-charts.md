Language courses had the highest number of participants overall, with 40 female and 20 male students, while painting was a popular choice among both genders, attracting 30 female and 25 male attendees. The only course with a higher number of males was sculpture, but this course was token by a mere 15 people in total.

Looking at the page profile pie chart, we can see that the majority of people attending evening lessons were over 40 years of age. To be precise (确切地讲), 42% of them were aged 50 or more, and 26% were aged between 40 and 49. Younger adults were in the minority, with only 11% of students aged 20 to 29, and only 5% aged under 20.
