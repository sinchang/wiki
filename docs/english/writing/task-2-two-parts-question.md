# Task2 Two part questions

## Sample Answer

```
News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in
newspapers. What factors do you think influence these decisions? Do we become
used to bad news, and would it be better if more good news was reported?
```

It is true that editors have to make difficult decisions about which news stories broadcast or publish, and their choices are not doubt influenced by a variety of factors. In my opinion, we are exposed to too much bad news, and I would welcome a greater emphasis (n. 强调, 重点) on good news.

Editors face a range of considerations when deciding what news stories to focus on. Firstly, I imagine that they have to consider whether viewers or readers will be interested enough to choose their television or their newspaper over completing providers. Secondly, news editors have a responsibility to inform the public about important events and issues, and they should therefore priorities stories that are in the public interest. Finally, editors are probably under some pressure from the owners who employ them. For example, a newspaper owner might have particular political views that he or she wants to promote.

It seems to me that people do become accustomed to negative news. We are exposed on daily basis to stories about war, crime, natural disasters and tragic (adj. 悲剧的；悲痛的，不幸的) suffering around the world. I believe that such repeated exposure gradually desensitises people, and we become more cynical (adj. 愤世嫉俗的；冷嘲的) about the world and more sceptical (adj. 不肯相信的; 常怀疑的) that we can do anything to change it. I would prefer to see more positive news stories, such as reports of the work of medical staff after a natural disaster, or the kindness of volunteers who help in their communities. This kind of news might inspire us all to lead better lives.

In conclusion, it must be extremely difficult for editors to choose which news stories to present, but I would like to see a more positive approach to this vital public service.
