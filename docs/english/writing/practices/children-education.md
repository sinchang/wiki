# Task2: Parents should teach children how to be good members of society

People have different views about whether the parents or the school should teach children how to become a nice members of society. Both them are play an important role on the growth of the children, but I think the school is the place where the children learn to be a good person.

On the one hand, some parents might does not live with their children from a small age, so they have no chance to teach the children. For example, there are many left-behind children in the China's village, their parents goes to the big city for work and come back to home with one time or two times per year. Furthermore, in the development country, some parents did not have a good education when they were young, so they maybe don't have enough knowledge to tech their children how to be a good person.

On the other hand, everyone spend on the school almost 20 years, from nursery school to university. Firstly, We have lots of teachers in the school who graduated from the good university, they can tech the children to be good members of the society based on their experiences and knowledge. Secondly, every school has a library basically, the children can tech themselves by reading books. Finally, in the school the children can talk or play with the classmates, it's good for their mental health and communication skills.

In conclusion then, I believe that the school is a great place for the children to learn the knowledge and live skills, good education is important for the children's growth.

There is a debate regarding whether parents or schools should take on the responsibility of teaching children how to become respectable members of society. While both parental guidance and school education have significant impacts on children's development, I am inclined to believe that schools play a more crucial role in shaping a child's character.

On one hand, some parents may not have the opportunity to instill values in their children, especially if they are absent due to work commitments or lack the necessary education themselves. For instance, in rural areas of China, many children are left behind by parents who migrate to urban centers for employment, leaving them devoid of parental guidance for most of the year. Similarly, in developing countries, parents with limited education may struggle to impart essential life lessons to their children.

On the other hand, the school environment is designed to foster holistic development over the course of approximately 20 years, from early childhood education to higher education. Firstly, schools employ qualified teachers who have received education from esteemed institutions and possess the expertise to nurture students into responsible members of society. Secondly, school libraries offer a wealth of resources for self-learning, enabling students to broaden their understanding of societal values and norms. Lastly, interactions with peers in a school setting promote mental well-being and enhance communication skills, essential components of becoming a well-rounded individual.

In conclusion, I am of the opinion that schools serve as an ideal setting for children to acquire knowledge and essential life skills. Quality education provided in schools is integral to the holistic development of children, equipping them with the tools needed to navigate societal expectations and contribute positively to the community.

It is important to encourage children to become good members of society. This means things like being a law-biding citizen, contributing to your community and being prepared to work and study hard. But who is best placed to do this?

One argument is that parents should teach children these things. They are, after all, with their children for long periods of time and they generally know their children inside-out. This makes them ideally placed to discuss behaviour with their children and also their reaction to events they might see in the media. For example, if a child is unkind to another person, or if they see a news story about a political leader clearly lying on television, parents can explain why this is unacceptable behabiour. In so doing children will learn the difference between right and wrong and so they will be less likely to do the same thing themselves. Furthermore, parents can lead by example, showing their children how to be a good citizen through their actions. They could, for instance, get involved in voluntary work at a local food bank, and by doing this, their children will actually see why it is important to give back to their community.

However, an alternative view is that schools should take responsibility for this crucial part of a child's education. Teachers, unlike parents, are usually well trained to deliver important life lessons and, armed with good resources, they can quickly and effectively ensure that children learn what it is to be a good citizen. Indeed, many schools already do this; In the United Kingdom, for example, many schools now teach personal and social education as part of the school curriculum, and, at high school level, this subject includes the obligations of citizenship, and the importance of contributing towards one's own community through voluntary work.

Personally, I feel that schools and parents should be jointly responsible for teaching children to become good citizen. Parents are well-placed to lead by example and through discussion, while teachers are able to do the same thing in a more explicit way as part of the school curriculum. In other words, it should be a team effort.
