# Goods transported in UK

The graph illustrates the number of goods transported by four types of transport in the UK from 1974 to 2002.

Overall, it can be seen that the quantities of goods transported by road has increased in general in over a 28 year period, whereas there is a similar trend in water transport and pipeline transport. Meanwhile, the number of goods transported by rail almost not changed in this period.

The quantities of goods transported by road started at 70 million tonnes in 1974, it increased to over 80 million tonnes in 1992, then slightly dropping, At the end of the period, it reached around 98 million tonnes. The quantities of goods transported by water and rail was almost the same in 1791, approximately 40 million tonnes, kept at the same level until 1978. They had the opposite trend between 1978 and 1984, accounting for 58 million tonnes and 30 million tonnes respectively in the end. At the end of the period, the quantities of goods transported by water was more 20 million tonnes than the quantities by rail, at about 65 million tonnes.

For the pipeline transport, the quantities of goods through this way was increased from 5 million tonnes to 22 million tonnes during between 1974 and 1995, then kept at the same level until the end of the period.

## Sample Answer

The graph illustrates the quantities of goods transported in the United Kingdom by four different models of transport between the time period of 1974 an 2002. Over this span of 28 years, the quantities of goods transported by roads, water and pipeline have all increased while the quantities transported by rail has remained almost constant at about 40 million tonnes.

The largest quantity of goods transported both in 1974 and 2002 was by road (70 million tonnes and 98 million tonnes respectively) while the lowest both in 1974 and 2002 was by pipeline (about 5 million tonnes and 22 million tonnes respectively). The amount of goods transported by water was constant from 1974 to 1978, where is showed an exponential growth, rising to almost 60 million tonnes after which it plateaued for about 20 years before starting to rise gradually again.

The amount of goods transported by rail almost constant at 40 million tonnes in 1974 and 2002, with decreases in quantity in between the years. It is also interesting to note that almost all showed a decrease in 1994 in amount of goods transported except for the pipeline, which actually peaked in that year.

In conclusion the road remains the most popular method of transporting goods in the UK while water and pipeline are becoming increasingly used, have not become more popular as a method of transport.
