# Destination of UK students

The bar charts display what UK graduate and postgraduate students went on to do after leaving university in 2008. Those who started working full-time were excluded.

Overall, the most common destination for graduate students was further study and the least common was voluntary work. The same was true of postgraduate students.

At nearly 30,000 graduates who continued to further studies greatly outnumbered their counterparts who ended up in other situation. In comparison, only 3,500 graduates did voluntary work, making it the least common graduate destination. Those who work part-time and those who were unemployed were very similar in number, at 17,735 and 16,235 respectively.

Those who did further study, at 2,725 and those who did voluntary work, at 345, were also the biggest and smallest groups respectively for postgraduates. However, far more postgraduates did part-time work, 2,535, than went into unemployment, at 1,625.
