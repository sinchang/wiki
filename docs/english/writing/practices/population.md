The chart illustrates the population of two countries (India and China) between the year 2000 and 2050, including the population change projections from the present to the year 2050. Units are measured in billions.

Overall, it can be seen that India's population grew rapidly from 2000 to 2050, while China's peaked in 2030 before declining. The population has a cross point in the year 2030.

With regard to China's population, it started with about 1250 billion people in 2000 and then gradually increasing to 2030 at almost 1440 billion people. After that, it decreases steadily to a level of 1400 billion people in 2050.

In 2000, India's population was 1000 billion. Before the year of the 2050, it grows rapidly and will reach at 1600 billion on the end of period.

## Sample Answer

The graph gives information about population growth in China and India from the year 2000 with predicted changes to 2050.

In 2000, China's population stood at 1.25 billion and this number rose steadily to where it is currently at around 1.35 billion. It is projected to peak at 1.45 billion in 2025, when the number with level off and start to decline. (当数字趋于平稳并开始下降时。) It is expected that by 2050 the population will have dropped slightly to 1.4 billion.

In contrast, although the population of India started at just one billion in 2000, it has increased rapidly to just under 1.25 billion today. The data indicate it will continue its upward surge, overtaking China in 2030 and reaching a peak of 1.6 billion by 2050.

Overall, the major difference between the two population trends is that the number of people in China is forecast to start falling after 2030 whereas the population of India will continue to soar.
