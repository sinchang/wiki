## Sample Answer

The line graph compares the proportion of internet users in three countries between 199 and 2009.

Generally, it is noticeable that in each of the three countries, the proportion of the population who used the internet increased significantly over the period shown. It is also clear that a much larger percentage of Canadians and Americans had access to the internet in comparison with Mexicans.

In 1999, the proportion of people using the internet in the USA was about 20%. By contrast, the figures for Canada and Mexico were lower, at about 10% and 5% respectively. In 2005, internet usage in both the USA and Canada gradually rose to around 70% of the population while the figure for Mexico increased slightly to 25%.

In 2009, the percentage of internet users was the hightest in Canada, which rose steadily to almost 100%. In contrast, although the proportion of Americans and Mexicans who used the internet also increased, the figures for them were 80% and 40% respectively.
